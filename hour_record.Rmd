# Idea

The Hour Record is a attempt to drive a bike as far as possible in one hour.

# Data

The Data consists of screenshots of the lap numbers and times.

Example image lap number:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("file_in/campenaerts/lap_img/Screenshot (340).png")
```

Example image lap time:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("file_in/campenaerts/time_img/Screenshot (340).png")
```

Get lap number from image:

```{embed}
"R/nr_from_image.R"
```

Parse numbers:

```{embed}
"R/time.R"
```

Preprocess data:

* Nice athlete name
* Speed in kilometers per hour

```{embed}
"R/time_pro.R"
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
tar_read(df_time_pro)
```

# Plot

```{embed}
"R/vis_time_all.R"
```

```{r vis_hour_record, echo=FALSE}
tar_read(gg_time_all)
```
